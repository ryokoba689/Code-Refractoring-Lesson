## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

I was given the starter code and was given the task of making it more connective and user firendly.



## Website is mainly used to help people access the Horiseon website and the website is able to use search engines to make it more user friendly and accessible

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```


**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

##Usage
The bottom will show you how the website is used and its applications
